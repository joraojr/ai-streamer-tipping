        This experiment consists of three parts.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Part One, the experiment is explained. You will be asked to fill in
        comprehension questions after the explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Part Two, you will interact in a group with other participants. This part will start automatically as soon as
        all participants have finished Part One.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Part Three, we will ask you to fill out a survey.
    </p>

        Please click "Next" to start with Part One.
