        This experiment consists of four parts.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Part One, we will ask you to fill out a survey.

    </p>
    <p>
        In Part Two, the experiment is explained. You will be asked to fill in comprehension questions after the explanation and play a demo round of
        the experiment's task.

    </p>
    <p>
        In Part Three, you will interact in a group with other participants. This part will start automatically as soon
        as all participants have finished Part Two.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Part Four, we will ask you to fill out a survey and then inform you about your payouts.

    <p>
        After Part Four, you will be forwarded to a separate page to enter your bank information.

    </p>
