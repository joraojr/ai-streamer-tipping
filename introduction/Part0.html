    <p>
        Welcome and thank you for participating in the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following instructions are the same for all participants. Please read these instructions carefully, as they
        will explain how you will earn money and how your earnings will depend on the choices that you make.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please do not communicate with other participants during the entire experiment. If you have any questions,
        please raise your hand and an experimenter will come to you and answer your questions privately. Please make
        sure to switch-off and stow away your phones and other electronic devices. If you do not follow these rules, we
        may have to exclude you from the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, you will earn money according to the rules outlined in the following pages. The exact amount
        will depend on your own decisions and on the decisions of other participants. Your identity will not be revealed
        to other participants and theirs not to you: in this sense, your participation is anonymous. You will also
        receive an additional {{ show_up_fee }} show-up fee that is not dependent on your decisions or the decisions
        of other participants.

    </p>

    <p>
        At end of the experiment, we will ask for your bank information to transfer the payout to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bank information and behavioral data will be stored separately.

    </p>

    <p>
        Please click "Next" to start.
