        Welcome and thank you for participating in the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following instructions are the same for all participants. Please read these instructions carefully, as they
        will explain how you will earn money and how your earnings will depend on the choices that you make.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please do not communicate with other participants during the entire experiment, other than instructed. If you
        have any questions, please raise your hand and an experimenter will come to you and answer your questions
        privately. Please make sure to switch-off and stow away your phones and other electronic devices. If you do not
        follow these rules, we may have to exclude you from any payments.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, you will earn money according to the rules outlined in the following pages. The exact amount
        will depend on your own decisions and on the decisions of other participants. Your identity will not be revealed
        to other participants and theirs not to you: in this sense, your participation is anonymous.
